My name is Artun Dalyan. I have graduated from UC Berkeley in EECS major. During my childhood, reading about new scientific advancements and new automobiles in magazines was my hobby and that’s why I wanted to be an engineer. I applied to UC Berkeley as an undeclared engineer. By learning more about different majors in my first year, I declared my major as Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Working with circuits is my passion that’s why I pursue my career in the field of Electrical Engineering. I have done projects on analog and digital circuit designs such as CPU design on a Field Programmable Gate Array and Operational Amplifiers. I am hoping to be a part of Brain Machine Interface research in the future. I think the mystery of our brain has yet to be solved. However, before getting involved with this research, my priority is to gain more experience in analog hardware designs in the industry.




## Projects

### Analog Design for a Microprocessor
Designing all analog components including 8 bit successive-approximation analog to digital converter (ADC), programmable gain switched capacitor pre-amplifier (PGA), bandgap voltage reference and Temperature sensor (BGT), Analog multiplexer (MUX) and Analog and digital voltage regulators (AREG, DREG) with a team of three.

### CPU Design on FPGA
Designing a 3-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU with a UART for tethering on Xilinx Pynq platform. On top of this CPU, audio synthesizer is implemented with PWM Controller, FIFO and a simple polyphonic subtractive synthe- sizer with amplitude (ADSR) envelopes.

### C.H.A.D. Robot
Design and control of a Baxter robot using ROS to play Beer Pong.[Website](https://chad-bot.github.io/Beer-Pong)

Computer Vision for detecting cups, Path Planning to aim at cups and a custom end effector design are achieved.
