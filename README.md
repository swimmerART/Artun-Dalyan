My name is Artun Dalyan. I have graduated from UC Berkeley in EECS major. During my childhood, reading about new scientific advancements and new automobiles in magazines was my hobby and that’s why I wanted to be an engineer. I applied to UC Berkeley as an undeclared engineer. By learning more about different majors in my first year, I declared my major as Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Working with circuits is my passion that’s why I pursue my career in the field of Electrical Engineering. I have done projects on analog and digital circuit designs such as CPU design on a Field Programmable Gate Array and Operational Amplifiers. I am hoping to be a part of Brain Machine Interface research in the future. Of all the objects in the universe, the human brain is the most complex. It is no surprise that, despite recent advances in the science of the brain and mind, still the mystery of our brain has yet to be solved. But we are at least beginning to grasp the crucial mysteries of neuroscience and starting to make headway in addressing them. However, before getting involved with this research, my priority is to gain more experience in analog hardware designs in the industry.




## Projects

### Analog Design for a Microprocessor
Designing all analog components including 8 bit successive-approximation analog to digital converter (ADC), programmable gain switched capacitor pre-amplifier (PGA), bandgap voltage reference and Temperature sensor (BGT), Analog multiplexer (MUX) and Analog and digital voltage regulators (AREG, DREG) with a team of three.

### [EMG Based Control for Hand Prostheses](https://minabeshay.github.io/sEMGProjectWebsite)
This project aims to develop a pre-processing procedure to better actuate a prosthetic arm using muscle signals from the forearm of a patient with the use of Surface Electromyography (sEMG) sensors. Actuation signals are recorded for two motions: Open Palm and Closed Fist. Applying discrete wavelet transform on the signals, features are extracted and classified using skLearn classifiers. The signals are classified according to motion type and sample test data is used to predict the motion according to the processed signal data. The results show that it is possible to improve identification accuracy of motions from arm muscle signals.

### CPU Design on FPGA
Designing a 3-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU with a UART for tethering on Xilinx Pynq platform. On top of this CPU, audio synthesizer is implemented with PWM Controller, FIFO and a simple polyphonic subtractive synthe- sizer with amplitude (ADSR) envelopes.

### [C.H.A.D. Robot](https://chad-bot.github.io/Beer-Pong).
Design and control of a Baxter robot using ROS to play Beer Pong.
Computer Vision for detecting cups, Path Planning to aim at cups and a custom end effector design are achieved.

### Multistage Amplifier Design
Common Source-Common Gate-Common Drain stages are connected 97.5V/V midband gain with a 3V peak-to- peak output swing and 80Hz - 350kHz bandwidth are established. BS170 NMOS transistor and BS250 PMOS transistor are used.

### SIXTEEN Robot Car
Built bottom-up a voice-controlled car using the Arduino IDE and a Texas Instruments Launchpad.
Assembled a mic-board, built the whole circuit system, created a closed-loop feedback controlled algorithm, and
used least squares to optimize the performance of the motors.
Voice-detection and word-classification for the voice control feature are done using PCA and SVD methods.

### BearMaps
Developed the back-end of a mapping application of Berkeley using Java, Apache Maven, and images downloaded from OpenStreetMap.
Created a quad tree to filter through thousands of images and raster the appropriate ones into the front end. It can handle features such as moving the screen by dragging, zooming in/out, and double clicking two points to find the shortest path.
Employed A* (A star) algorithm using a priority queue to find the shortest path between two given points.
